               All iPhone 14s in the US will be sold without a SIM tray: the manufacturer says that improved eSIM
               technology will allow you to transfer old electronic SIM cards to new smartphones.

               The iPhone 14 Pro came out in a new design - without the branded “bangs”. A new color has also been added to
               the range. The smartphone, unlike the "regular" 14 iPhones, has an A16 Bionic processor, which can perform 4
               trillion photo operations per second.
